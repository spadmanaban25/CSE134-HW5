Updates to this version of Site:
1. Added HTML Custom Element Functionality that retrives JSON data from local Storage and/or Remote Server and displays on site through custom Card Element

2. Added JS functionality for loading these cards with buttons to allow user to load from local storage or from remote server

3. Fixed minor CSS bugs such as fixed position for element and keeping theme changes consistent with card elements (i.e, font color, background color)
